{% card(title="What is a hackathon?") %}
A hackathon is a weekend of fun and coding. You will learn how to become a better programmer, meet new faces, and get free food! You will also have the opportunity to win prizes and network with our sponsors.
{% end %}

{% card(title="What if I don't know how to code?") %}
AppHack is beginner-friendly. We encourage you to attend because it is a great place to start learning how to code. If you don't want to create a project, we have workshops and other fun activities for you throughout the night.
{% end %}

{% card(title="Am I allowed to participate?") %}
All undergraduate and graduate students are welcome!
{% end %}

{% card(title="Do I need to pay anything to participate?") %}
No, this event is completely free.
{% end %}

{% card(title="How do I find a teammate?") %}
Teams can be organized before the event and during the event itself. Team size should be no more than 4 members. Closer to the event, we will create a Discord group chat. You can find your teammates that way.
{% end %}

{% card(title="I forgot to pre-register, can I still come?") %}
Yes! You can register at the event!
{% end %}

{% card(title="What if I don't finish my project?") %}
We encourage you to submit anyways because it does not disqualify you from prizes. It is also a significant accomplishment to work on a project for 48 hours! We love to hear about what your idea was.
