            <span>What is a hackathon?</span>
            <p>
                A hackathon is a weekend of fun and coding. You will learn how to become a better programmer, meet new faces, and get free food! You will also have the opportunity to win prizes and network with our sponsors.

            <p>We encourage you to submit anyways because it does not disqualify you from prizes. It is also a significant accomplishment to work on a project for 48 hours! We love to hear about what your idea was.</p>
