    <p>
    AppHack is a 48-hour, virtual, student-run hackathon hosted at Appalachian State University. At AppHack, teams of students get involved in the software development process including design, development, and marketing disciplines. In addition to being a highly productive environment, AppHack is loads of fun! We offer awesome prizes for outstanding projects!

    AppHack 2021 will be virtual due to COVID-19, but we will make sure to bring you the best AppHack experience possible. Our main form of communications will be through Discord. To get an invite to our Discord, please register above!
